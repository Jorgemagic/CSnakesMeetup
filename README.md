# CSnakesMeetup

This repository contains a collection of demos and examples used during the online talk **"Interoperability between C# and Python using CSnakes"**, presented on **June 5th, 2025** for the **[DotNet Sevilla](https://www.meetup.com/sevilladotnet/events/308155291/)** community.

The session showcased how to **combine the power of Python with the .NET ecosystem** using [CSnakes](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/), a library that enables direct interop between both languages with no need for REST APIs or IPC mechanisms.

## 📂 Contents

The repo includes:

- ✅ Basic examples of calling Python functions from C#
- 🧠 Integration with LLMs using the [`llm`](https://pypi.org/project/llm/) Python package
- 🖼️ Image processing demos using OpenCV and Segment Anything
- 🔁 Buffer exchange between C# and Python with `IPyBuffer`
- ⚙️ Utilities to pass multi-dimensional arrays efficiently
- 🐍 Python scripts and dynamic module bindings

## 💻 Requirements

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Python 3.10+

> ✅ No manual installation required: all Python dependencies are automatically installed via CSnakes when running the examples.

## 🎤 About the Talk

> “Interoperability is the best way to combine the strengths of different ecosystems. CSnakes bridges the gap between .NET and Python, enabling powerful hybrid applications that leverage the best of both worlds.”
